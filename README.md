AntTweakBar development library
-------------------------------

This is yet another modified version of the Anttweakbar 2.0 mod found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/anttweakbarsdl20/?source=navbar. This original mod, however only lets you download a .vcproj file while This version lets you download files, gives a working Makefile that let's you install and deinstall everything cleanly. I also added an SDL2 Example, that actually compiles!

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based 
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the development version of the AntTweakBar library 
for Windows, GNU/Linux and OSX, and some program examples (sources + binaries).
